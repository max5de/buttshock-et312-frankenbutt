# Buttshock - ET-312 Frankenfirmware

## Project Goals

This project exists to add small bug fixes, security fixes, and
features to the ET-312 Electrostimulation Device Firmware.

## Requirements

To apply firmware patches you'll need

- a copy of repo [https://github.com/metafetish/buttshock-et312-firmware/](https://github.com/orgasmscience/buttshock-et312-firmware)
- base firmware created from above repo
- a firmware patch file (it's plain text)

To create firmware patches you'll need

- Some Linux box
- packages avr-as (avr-binutils package or similar)
- a knowledge of AVR assembler

## Quick Start to create new firmware patches

Run Make.  It will compile some example patches and create the patch
file.  It will also run the commands to do the patching, ready to
upload to your box.  Then put the box in bootloader upload mode (hold
"Menu" and "UP" while turning on and both lights should flash).  Use
the utils part of the firmware repo to upload to your box.

f002 is an example which

- changes the box xor byte to 0 instead of random
- allows serial connections to read more memory locations
- adds a new sub-menu "More Options" and moves serial link to that menu
- adds a menu item "Debug Mode" to the new sub-menu
- adds a counter in the bottom right of the LCD that just increments when debug mode is enabled
- adds a menu item "Random3" to the new sub-menu
  Random3 mode turns on a favourite mode for a random time, then turns off the outputs for
  another random time, repeating this.  A bit like Random1 but without the random MA knob
  and with random periods with no stimulation
[- moves the reset code out of the way of the 1.5 bootloader jump]

## FAQ

### WHY?!

There's probably hundreds if not thousands of ET-312 boxes around the
world. We'd like them to work better.
